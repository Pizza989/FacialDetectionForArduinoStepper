# FacialDetectionForArduinoStepper



Make https://github.com/rsimai/arduino-stepper move towards faces

Unfortunately open-cv is sometimes not able to capture a camera by its index, I can't figure out why.

# Usage
- start main.py

# Dependencies
Open-cv: https://github.com/opencv/opencv
VideoCaptureDevice
Aruino at /dev/ttyACM0 running aruino-stepper script
